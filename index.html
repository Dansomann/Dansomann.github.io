        <h2><u>About the school</u></h2>
        <p> Nimbus Heights High School was founded in the early 1920s by a group of visionary educators and community leaders who sought to provide the children of Nimbus with a well-rounded education. The school was initially a modest three-story building, accommodating a small student population. As the town grew and prospered, so did the school.<br> Our school provides high end technology, football(soccer), basketball, volleyball, cross country running, sailing, rowing, swimming, and water skiing.</p>
