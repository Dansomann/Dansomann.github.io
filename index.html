    <h2><u>About the school</u></h2>
    <p> Nimbus Heights High School was founded in the early 1920s by a group of visionary educators and community leaders who sought to provide the children of Nimbus with a well-rounded education. The school was initially a modest three-story building, accommodating a small student population. As the town grew and prospered, so did the school.</p>
